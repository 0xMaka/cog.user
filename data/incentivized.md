### Incentivized cog pairs
These are the glowing pairs on the UI, offering a boost to point earning.

Please note that users have been prompted to consider moving over to v2 pools, which boast higher collateralization ratios, improved oracles and upgrades to off-chain indexing. There are no incentivized V2 pools that I am aware of, though pairs are in the process of being deployed so will add as they become available.
